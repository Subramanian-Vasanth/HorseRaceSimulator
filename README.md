\# Horse Race Simulator

\## Overview

This repository contains code for the Horse Race Simulator project,
which simulates horse races using Java. The project is divided into two
parts: Part 1 (Textual Horse Races) and Part 2 (Horse Racing GUI).

\## Part 1: Textual Horse Races

The \`Part1\` folder contains the code for the first part of the
project. This part implements the basic functionality and logic for
simulating horse races in a textual format.

\### Setup

To run Part 1 of the project, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK)
installed on your system.

\### Running the Code

1\. Navigate to the \`Part1\` folder. 2. Compile the Java files using
the following command: \`javac Race.java\` 3. Run the compiled \`Race\`
class using the following command: \`java Race\`

\## Part 2: Horse Racing GUI

The \`Part2\` folder contains the code for the second part of the
project, which implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for the horse
racing simulation.

\### Dependencies

Part 2 of the project requires the Java Swing library for GUI
components.

\### Setup

Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.

\### Running the GUI

1\. Navigate to the \`Part2\` folder. 2. Compile the Java files using
the following command: \`javac HorseRaceGUI.java\` 3. Run the compiled
\`HorseRaceGUI\` class using the following command: \`java
HorseRaceGUI\`

For convinience, pre-compiled \'.class\' files are included, However it
is recommended that you compile them yourself to ensure compatability.
